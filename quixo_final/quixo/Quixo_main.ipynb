    "We started by using a MinMax strategy.\n",
    "Since the solution tree is huge we have to set a limit to the depth (cut-off). By doing some test we found that the evaluation of non terminal node could use the difference between zeroes and ones: in this way we are forcing our agent to choose to place more zeroes by picking neutral elements than picking zeroes tiles at the beginning of the games. The idea is that by putting more zeroes the chance of winning later is higher."
